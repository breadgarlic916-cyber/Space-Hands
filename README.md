# Space-Hands
This is a project heavily inspired off space station 13, but is meant to have a different aesthetic, perspectives, progression, and is also meant to be single player with NPC's playing the other players. It's more of a solo challenge and the mechanics won't all be the same, as well as my own added mechanics, features, and possibly lore.
